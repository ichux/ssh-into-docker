# ssh-into-docker

SSH into a Docker Container with nginx as an example. There could be one or more reasons why you would want to do things like this, even though it is discouraged.

I have a need for it and as such decided to do it, but purely for my development environment.

# How to
Follow the steps stated in [how-to.txt](how-to.txt)

# ssh files
The files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` are for demo purposes. You should try as much as you can to create yours. I do not want to delete it, just for completeness!
